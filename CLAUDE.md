refer docs/contents for how to use this framework

refer "How to build from source" part in docs/contents/contributing.md for how to build&test.

When work finished, you should fix lint errors, and run `./scripts/format.sh` to format the code.

When I ask to you to write test, if your test fails and you think your test is correct, you should ask me to check, instead of just modify the test code to make it pass.
