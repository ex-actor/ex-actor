**ðŸ“– [Documentation](https://ex-actor.github.io/ex-actor/)**

**ex_actor** is a modern C++ [actor framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) based on `std::execution`. **Only requires C++20 [(?)](#faqs)**.

This framework turns you C++ class into a remote service(so called actor). All method calls to it will be pushed into the mailbox(a queue) of the actor and executed in serial. So in your class you don't need any lock, just focus on your logic.

When the actor is local, args in method will be moved directly in memory. When it's a remote actor, I'll help you to serialize them, send through network, and get the return value back.

This programming model is called "Actor Model". Where each actor can receive message, execute it, and send to other actors. It's a very easy way to write highly parallelized programs, because you don't need any locks in your code. Just write normal classes.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELwEdb_pD0k) gives a good introduction to the Actor Model from high level.

# Key Features

1. **Easy to Use** - Turn your existing class into an actor. No arcane macros and inheritance.
2. **Pluggable Scheduler** - Use any std::execution scheduler you like! We also provide some out-of-box, e.g. work-sharing & work-stealing thread pool.
3. **Standard-Compliant API** - Our actor returns a standard `std::execution::task`, compatible with everything in the std::execution ecosystem. You can `co_await` it, use `ex::then` to wrap etc.


# API Glance

Note: currently we're based on std::execution's early implementation - [stdexec](https://github.com/NVIDIA/stdexec),
so you'll see namespaces like `stdexec` and `exec` instead of `std::execution` in the following example.

<!-- doc test start -->
```cpp
#include <cassert>
#include "ex_actor/api.h"

struct YourClass {
  int Add(int x) { return count += x; }
  int count = 0;
};

exec::task<int> Test() {
  // 1. Choose a std::execution scheduler you like.
  ex_actor::WorkSharingThreadPool thread_pool(10);
  ex_actor::ActorRegistry registry(thread_pool.GetScheduler());

  // 2. Create the actor.
  ex_actor::ActorRef actor = registry.CreateActor<YourClass>();

  // 3. Call it! It returns a `std::execution::task`.
  auto task = actor.Send<&YourClass::Add>(1) 
              | stdexec::then([](int value) { return value + 1; });
  co_return co_await std::move(task);
}

int main() {
  auto [res] = stdexec::sync_wait(Test()).value();
  assert(res == 2);
}
```
<!-- doc test end -->

# FAQs

## `std::execution` is in C++26, why you only requires C++20?

C++26 is not finalized, now we depends on an early implementation of `std::execution` - [nvidia/stdexec](https://github.com/NVIDIA/stdexec), which only requires C++20. (it's like `fmtlib` vs `std::format` and `ranges-v3` vs `std::ranges`)

Once C++26 is ready, we'll add a build option to switch to the real `std::execution` in C++26, allow you to remove the dependency on `stdexec`. And it'll only be an option, you can still use `stdexec` because all senders based on `stdexec` will work well with `std::execution`.

**From our side, we'll keep our code compatible with both `stdexec` and `std::execution`**. So don't worry about the dependency.

BTW, with C++26's reflection, most boilerplate of the distributed mode API can be eliminated. I'll add a new set of APIs for C++26 in the future, stay tuned!

## Is it production-ready?

The single-process mode is heavily tested in our company's production environment. While minor bugs can occur due to version divergence btw open source & internal codes, the overall quality is good, feel free to use it in production.

The distributed mode is still in early stage. Welcome to have a try and build together with us!

## The Team Behind `ex_actor`

We are [Beijing Qianxiang Private Fund Management Co., Ltd (ä¹¾è±¡æŠ•èµ„)](https://www.qianxiang.cn/), founded in 2018, a technology-driven investment management firm with a focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning. We deeply integrate and enhance machine learning algorithms, applying them to financial data characterized by extremely low signal-to-noise ratios, and thereby generating sustainable returns with low risks for our investors.

In the process of engineering our trading system, we discovered that no existing actor framework on the market could meet our specific requirements. Consequently, we built one from the ground up.

While this framework has some successful applications internally, we believe there are more valuable use case in the community which can make it more sophisticated. So we open-source ex_actor, look forward to building it together with you!
