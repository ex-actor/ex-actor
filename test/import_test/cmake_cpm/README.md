# Install using CPM
You may need to add CPM to your project first, see: https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake#adding-cpm

TL;DR:

run the following commands to get CPM.cmake:
```bash
mkdir -p cmake
wget -O cmake/CPM.cmake https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake/releases/latest/download/get_cpm.cmake
```
